## Browserify Gulp Exercise

Use what you know about gulp and browserify to make a build process that:

1. Bundles up your code with a task
2. minifies your bundled code after bundling with a task
3. watches for changes and runs the first 2 tasks automatically

Using you new build tool, write a simple program to convert rgb color to hex. Use the following package to do it:

[rgb to hex npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rgb-hex)

### Bonus

Add another task that will also start a server to host these files. Call this task 'serve'.
