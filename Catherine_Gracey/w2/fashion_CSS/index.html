          <p class="firstPara">I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly fashion, but an idea of beauty. Comfort is very important to me. I think people live better in big houses and in big clothes. There is always an emotional element to anything that you make. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. I've always tried to push myself technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey. Even Michelangelo got paid for doing the Sistine Chapel. To those artists who say they're doing it for the love of art, I say: Get real. I never look at other people's work. My mind has to be completely focused on my own illusions. I love my beauty. It's not my fault. I design from instinct. It's the only way I know how to live. What feels good. What feels right. What is needed. Give me a problem and I will approach it creatively, from my gut. For me, the summer will be pure gray - mother-of-pearl gray, very pale gray. To me, this is the big statement for summer. Then we have light blue, light turquoise, lots of pink.</p>

          <h3>Vintage in Vogue</h3>

          <p class="firstPara">Brides today are increasingly sensitive to the tastes, feelings and finances of their attendants. We live in an era of globalization and the era of the woman. Never in the history of the world have women been more in control of their destiny. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk. My aim is to make the poor look rich and the rich look poor. I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going - I have no post-satisfaction. I am what I am. Before I was not so proud to make fashion. My family thought fashion wasn't very interesting. So I hid that. Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them. I like things simple. First I made a dress because I was pregnant and I wanted to be the most beautiful pregnant woman. Then I made a sweater because I wanted to have one that wasn't like anyone else's.</p>
